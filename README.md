# Bank Management System #
This project is my first attempt to design a full C project. \
I wrote this program with the help of linked list data structure and file handling. \
\
{+} First, you have to enter the system password (bank12ftj -by default-) . You can change it from the System_Methods header file.\
{+} Then you can choose whether you want to add, edit, delete, list an account, or do a transaction.\
{+} Finally you can quit the program by typing (q) from the keyboard. (if you force stop the program, your data won't be saved).\

If you have any ideas about the project then let me know.
